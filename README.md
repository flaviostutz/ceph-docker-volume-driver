# cepher
Docker Volume Plugin that enables the management of volumes on Ceph RBD backends.
This is a hard fork of https://github.com/yp-engineering/rbd-docker-plugin

This plugin will perform the following:

  - The name used on the volume will be used for locating the Ceph image (ex.: mypool/myvolume)
  - When creating/removing a volume, it will try to locate an image with that name and perform operations on Ceph cluster
  - When mounting a volume to a container, it will try to locate that image, create it if doesn't exist yet, map it to the host, format it using a specified filesystem (xfs is default), mount the device to an directory and Docker will bind that directory to the container
  - Only one mapping is permitted per image, so we will perform an exclusive lock on Ceph images to avoid corruption.

#### Performance note

Modern Linux Kernel comes with a Ceph module for mapping images as virtual devices on OS. This module is very efficient but it doesn't support recent features on Ceph Images, like journaling and fast-diff. By default this plugin will use the 'rbd-nbd' instead of the kernel module. It does the same mapping as the kernel module, but with a little less performance but supports all Ceph Image features. If you want to force Kernel Module usage, set USE\_RBD\_KERNEL\_MODULE to true.

## Usage (managed plugin)

* Set HOST_IP on .env to your machine IP
  * Not for Mac Users: you cannot access the ports exposed when using "network_mode: host", so the best is you to run Docker inside a Virtual Box Linux machine in this case
* Run a sample Ceph Storage Cluster

* Run Cepher plugin

```shell script
docker plugin install flaviostutz/cepher \
  --grant-all-permissions \
  --alias=cepher \
  MONITOR_HOSTS="${HOST_IP}:16789,${HOST_IP}:26789,${HOST_IP}:16789" \
  ETCD_URL="http://${HOST_IP}:12379" \
  DEFAULT_IMAGE_SIZE=100 \
  ENABLE_AUTO_CREATE_VOLUMES=true

```

* Test it!

```shell script
docker run -it --rm --volume-driver=cepher --name first --volume volumes/myimage:/mnt/foo ubuntu /bin/bash -c "echo -n 'Hello ' >> /mnt/foo/hello"

docker run -it --rm --volume-driver=cepher --name second --volume volumes/myimage:/mnt/foo ubuntu /bin/bash -c "cat /mnt/foo/hello"

```

## Custom pools

* There is a default "volumes" pool that this image prepares for you, but if you wish to create a customized pool, follow these steps

```shell script
  # connect to a container that can be used as a Ceph Client
  docker-compose exec mgr1 bash

  # create a pool for volume images (each volume in Docker will be an image in RDB)
  ceph osd pool create mypool 30
  rbd pool init mypool

  # set max bytes for this pool (optional)
  ceph osd pool set-quota mypool data max_bytes 1000000000

  # initialize this pool with rbd
  rbd pool init mypool
```

  See more at http://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/start/quick-rbd/ and http://docs.ceph.com/docs/jewel/rados/operations/pools/

* Run your container with a persisted volume in Ceph

```shell script
# run a container that will make the first usage of the image, so it will be
# created on Ceph during volume creation
# after echoing to a file in the newly created volume, this container will exit 
# and remove its instance's data, but not the image data.
docker run -it --rm --volume-driver=cepher --name first --volume volumes/myimage:/mnt/foo ubuntu /bin/bash -c "echo -n 'Hello ' >> /mnt/foo/hello"

# run a second docker container, but use the same volume/image from the previous
# step so that we can see the persisted data
docker run -it --rm --volume-driver=cepher --name second --volume volumes/myimage:/mnt/foo ubuntu /bin/bash -c "cat /mnt/foo/hello"

# on Ceph client machine, list the created image
docker-compose exec mgr1 bash
rbd ls default
```

## Driver opt configurations

* pool - name of Ceph pool
* name - name of Ceph image
* size - image size when creating a new image in MB
* fstype - filesystem type to create on newly created images. mkfs.[fstype] must be present in OS
* features - Ceph image features applied to newly created images. defaults to 'layering,striping,exclusive-lock,object-map,fast-diff,journaling'

 ## Sample production deployment

 Sample production deployment setup use this configuration:
 - Ubuntu 18.04 with kernel 4.15.0-50 (default)
 - Docker 18.09.6
 - docker-compose 1.23.2
 - Ceph 13.2.5

* We will use 8 machines on this sample
   * Machine 1 (MON): one MON container + one MGR container
   * Machine 2 (MON): one MON container
   * Machine 3 (MON): one MON container
   * Machine 4 (OSD): one OSD container + 50GB disk attached
   * Machine 5 (OSD): one OSD container + 50GB disk attached
   * Machine 6 (OSD): one OSD container + 50GB disk attached
   * Machine 7 (OSD): one OSD container + 50GB disk attached
   * Machine 8 (DOCKER): docker daemon with Cepher plugin

* Preparation
   * Create a second network connecting OSD hosts
   * On one machine, git clone http://github.com/flaviostutz/cepher
   * Edit .env and set IPs accordingly
   * Copy files to target machines

* On Machine 1 (MON):
   * run ```docker-compose up -f docker-compose-mon1.yml```

* On Machine 2 (MON):
   * run ```docker-compose up -f docker-compose-mon2.yml```

* On Machine 3 (MON):
   * run ```docker-compose up -f docker-compose-mon3.yml```

* For each Machines 4-7 (OSD):
   * edit docker-compose-osds.yml
     * set OSD_IP to the IP of this host in the same network as the other Monitors
     * set OSD_CLUSTER_IP to the IP of this host in the secondary network between OSDs
   * Prepare storage
     * Attach a disk to the host
     * Format it to XFS
     * Mount disk to '/mnt/osd1-sda' (place in fstab for automatic mounting during boot)
   * run ```docker-compose up -f docker-compose-osds.yml```
   * You can execute those exact steps for adding new storage even after the cluster is in use

* On Machine 8:
```shell script
docker plugin install flaviostutz/cepher \
  --grant-all-permissions \
  --alias=cepher \
  MONITOR_HOSTS="${MON1_IP}:16789,${MON2_IP}:26789,${MON3_IP}:36789" \
  ETCD_URL="http://${ETCD_IP}:12379" \
  DEFAULT_IMAGE_SIZE=100 \
  ENABLE_AUTO_CREATE_VOLUMES=true
```

* Validation

  * On Machine 1 (MON1)
```shell script
docker-compose exec mgr1 bash
ceph -s
#check for status
```

  * On Machine 8 (DOCKER)
```shell script
docker run -it --rm --volume-driver=cepher --name first --volume volumes/myimage:/mnt/foo ubuntu /bin/bash -c "echo -n 'Hello ' >> /mnt/foo/hello"

docker run -it --rm --volume-driver=cepher --name second --volume volumes/myimage:/mnt/foo ubuntu /bin/bash -c "cat /mnt/foo/hello"
```
